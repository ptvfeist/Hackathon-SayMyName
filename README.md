# Hackathon Project - "Say My Name" - Whatsapp Bot

// Project Description

Our final challenge as a group during our 12th week at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #71 & #73 Bootcamp @ Lisboa. For this Hackaton, we were challenged to develop a program within 24 hours using any technology that we knew, which should match with a given theme song.

The theme of our project was a song called "Say My Name" by Destiny's Child. 
This is about a woman who wants to hear her boyfriend speak affectionately to her because she suspects he's in a room with another woman.

// The Idea

After a brainstorm within my group, we came up with an idea of developing a webapp that would allow the users to log with their Whatsapp account and allow the system to automatically reply to any upcoming messages. The system would identify received messages on the account and, according to some key words identified on the message, reply with an appropriate response.

// Development

We first defined how would be the UI, which would allow the user to use the service. After this was defined, the next challenge was finding an API that allowed to connect with Whatsapp, monitor upcoming messages and respond on the chat. Once we found a proper API, we started building our business logic and the User Interface, dividing the tasks between all the group members. Once the MVP was done and presented, the project was chosen as the winner for the challenge.
